# ![Pass-In Logo](./src/assets/logo.png)

**Pass-In** is an app designed to streamline participant management at in-person events by generating unique QR code tickets for each attendee. With an intuitive interface, pass.in allows organizers to scan QR codes to efficiently register participant attendance without hassle.

## Technology

The following are the key technologies and tools used in the development of this project:

### Mobile

- **React Native**: A mobile app development framework enabling the building of webapps, native apps for iOS and Android and many other types of apps using JavaScript/Typescript. It facilitates mobile app development with a single codebase, providing a native user experience.
- **Expo**: An open-source platform and set of tools for building native mobile apps using JavaScript/Typescript and React Native. Expo provides a range of ready-to-use components and APIs that streamline app development, including access to features like the camera, geolocation, and push notifications.
- **Axios**: A simple promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. Axios provides a simple-to-use library in a small package with a highly extensible interface.
- **Zustand**: A minimalist state management library for React applications, offering a simple and intuitive API for managing application state, with support for global state, local state, and derived state. Zustand emphasizes simplicity, performance, and ease of use.
- **Async Storage**: A library for React Native that provides a simple asynchronous storage system for persisting key-value data in the app's local storage. It offers a straightforward API for storing, retrieving, and deleting data, making it easy to manage app state across sessions. Async Storage is commonly used for caching data, storing user preferences, and implementing offline functionality in mobile applications.
- **Expo Image Picker**: A library enabling developers to easily add image selection functionality to their Expo projects. With this library, users can choose images from their device's gallery or take photos using the device's camera.
- **Moti**: A declarative animations library for React Native that allows developers to create smooth and interactive animations with ease. It provides a simple API for defining animations using JavaScript syntax, making it straightforward to add motion to your app's UI elements.
- **React Native Reanimated**: A powerful animation library for React Native that provides a low-level API for building complex and high-performance animations. It allows developers to create fluid and responsive animations by directly manipulating the native animation drivers on the UI thread.
- **React Native QRCode Svg**: A library for generating QR codes in React Native applications using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). It allows developers to easily create QR codes from data strings and customize their appearance using SVG properties such as color, size, and style.

## How It Works

### Get Ticket by its code:

Allows users to retrieve a QR code ticket using its corresponding code.

### Create Ticket:

Allows users to generate a unique QR code ticket only if no credential has been created for that email address.

### Show Ticket:

Allows users to view their ticket QR code and remove it if necessary.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pedrohematos/pass-in-mobile.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd pass-in-mobile
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root folder based on the provided `.env.example` file and fill in the necessary environment variables, in this case the `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` variable.

   `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` is the environment variable pointing to the API endpoint. This API can be accessed in the pass-in-mobile-server available at [pass-in-server](https://github.com/pedrohematos/pass-in-server).

4. Install project dependencies using npm or any other package manager:

```bash
npm install
```

5. Scan the QR code using generated by the Expo Go app on your mobile device or use an emulator to test the app. For more information you can access the [Expo Go Documentation](https://expo.dev/)

## Future Improvements

- Implement authentication.
- Add administrator user functionality.
